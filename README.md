H.W. 1 from Data Ethics and Applied Analitics course

Day 1: I created a repository on github for homework. I solved the leetcode problems and uploaded their .py and .png files with solution codes and visual explanations.

Day 2: I got acquainted with task 2. I designed the package structure according to the pip8 and clean code standards and created a draft solution.

Day 3: I finished writing the code for task 2. I decided to adjust department means using Z-score outlier detection and computing the final 
weighted average based on the adjusted means. I wrote 24 test cases, got failed ones. I plan to fix them on day 4.
